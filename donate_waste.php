<p>
You can give the value generated from Recyclables and give the 
Reusable items donated for Charity. 
You're not only bringing smiles to several unfortunate people, 
but also helping environment by 

reducing waste.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recyclables can be given to recyclers and value 
	generated is used to make postpay donations for social 
	work projects.</li>
<li>Reusables like Clothes, Books, Toys etc. are given to 
Organisations serving the underprivileged.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To put it in a nutshell, here is an opportunity to â€“ Save the Planet, 
Serve the Poor / Kachra Daan, Karo Kalyan.
So the next time before we throw away a piece of paper or 
a polythene wrapper or any other waste, pause for a moment,
 and choose to donate it rather than throwing it away.
</p>

<h3 style="padding-left:0px;">What to Donate?</h3>

	donated for other communities.</li>
