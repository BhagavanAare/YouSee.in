<p>As a part of its Donate Waste (Kachra Daan) initiative, 
UC works with Residential, Office and Academic communities to Reduce, 
Segregate and Donate waste. Dry waste items are usually donated once a 
month on the last weekend. Items like papers, plastics, glass and metal 
are picked up by a waste recycler (Raddhiwala) from the local area. 
Electronic waste items are handed over to specialised e-waste recyclers.
 UC facilitates in linking the community with the waste recyclers. 
The value generated from the dry waste can be donated by the community 
to support some of the Health, Education or Environment projects 
supported by UC. </p>

<p>
During these donation camps, residents also donate old books 
and clothes, which are then redistributed to people who need them. </p>

<p>
UC also provides support to set up compost centers in these communities, 
so that their food and garden waste can be locally converted to 
organic manure, rather than being transported to landfills. </p>
<p>The Donate Waste initiative is very much a citizen driven initiative, 
which simultaneously delivers environmental outcomes and also resources 
 to support other social causes.

<h3 style="padding-left:0px">Starting and Managing a Donation Camp</h3>
<p>Starting a Donation Camp for Reusable and Recyclable items:
</p>
<ol style="line-height:20px;">
		<li><b>Identifying the Donation Camp Location: </b>This should 
		be a kind of public place(School, College, a Community space 
		with an Office or Residential Campus etc) which is easily 
		accessible for the public in that area.</li>
		<li><b>Finalise the Monthly Date and Time for the Camp:</b> 
		It would be ideal to have it on the last weekend of the month 
		e.g. on the last Sunday of every Month between 10am to 12pm.
		</li>
		<li><b>Mobilise</b> a few volunteers who can participate in some of 
		the above activities, in manning the donation camp and also 
		participate in subsequent sorting and distribution of the 
		reusable items to NGOs</li>
		<li><b>Identifying local Recyclers:</b>Before the commencement 
		of the initiative, we suggest the volunteers in the donating 
		community to identify a local recycler who will take most of the 
		paper, plastic, metal, glass etc waste items, and also explain 
		to the recycler the purpose behind the initiative. UC team can 
		also join the local volunteers in the initial survey. Once 
		the recyclers appreciate the initiative, they would provide 
		good support to this initiative including giving a better price 
		for the donated waste. On the donation camp date, the recycler 
		should come to the camp location, have the waste items weighed 
		there, hand over the money of the waste items and take away the 
		load in his vehicle. The value generated from the dry waste can 
		be donated by the community to support some of the Health, 
		Education or Environment projects.</li>
		<li><b>Identifying place(s)</b>in the area, where some of the 
		donated reusable items like clothes, books, toys etc. 
		can be stored temporarily before they are distributed to 
		NGOs.</li>
		<li>UC facilitates the distribution of reusable items donated to
		 various NGOs in the city. It develops the information list of 
		 NGOs running homes/shelters/schools etc. for the 
		 underprivileged, to whom the reusable items can be 
		 distributed.</li>
		 <li><b>Spread awareness</b> about the camp to those working and 
		 residing in the area. Prepare a few posters about the 
		 initiative which could be posted in offices and residential 
		 communities in the area. UC team has some existing posters and 
		 these can be further customised for the local community.</li>
		 <li><b> Managing the Donation Camp</b>
			 <ol type="a">
				 <li>Send reminder emails to all the offices and 
				 residential communities in the area 3-4 days before 
				 the monthly Donation Camp date.</li>
				 <li>Mobilise volunteers for the following tasks:
				 <ul>
					 <li><strong>Managing activities during the camp
					 (10:am to 12pm):</strong> 
					 have 3-4 volunteers who will receive items brought 
					 by donors, ensure that they are placed in 
					 segregated bags/bins and respond to any queries 
					 that the donors may have.</li>
					 <li><strong>Provide logistics support(1pm to 4pm):
					 </strong>
					 2-3 volunteers having personal 4-wheelers who can 
					 help move the donated reusable items to nearby 
					 storage center or NGO locations for distribution. 
					 Offices can also be invited to provide this 
					 logistics support.</li>
					 <li><b>Provide temporary storage space for donated 
					 items:</b>
					 Offices/Organisations or Individuals who can store 
					 3-4 cartons of donated materials temporarily, for 
					 further distributions to NGOs within a week to 10 
					 days, as not all NGOs can be reached out on the 
					 same day</li>
				 </ul></li>
			</ol>
		 </li>

<h3 style="padding-left:0px">Setting up and Managing a Compost center</h3>
<b>Setting up the Compost Center:</b>
<ol style="line-height:20px;">
	<li>Procure Material for compost beds - steel sheets, bamboo poles, 
	binding wire and posters. The design of the suggested compost beds 
	keeps it portable(they can be moved to another location reusing all 
	the material) and low cost.
	<ol type="a">
		<li><b>Number of Compost beds and Area:</b>
		the community can start by setting up 2 or 3 compost beds, 
		with 8*4 feet area each. We can leave 2 feet gap between the 
		two. After some initial experience in managing the compost beds,
		 the community can add additional compost beds based on the 
		volume of kitchen/garden waste generated.</li>
		<li><b>Material:</b>Each bed can be made with an enclosure of 
		corrugated steel sheets. We can use the standard 8*2.5 feet 
		sheet with 24gauge(Jindal steel or any other brand). These are 
		available at Wholesale Hardware markets. Each sheet would cost 
		about 700 to 800 rupees. One compost bed of the 8*4 feet area 
		would need 3 such sheets and would therefore cost about 2400 
		per bed. About 12 bamboo poles of 4feet height can be procured 
		locally for erecting each bed.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Arrange 2 or 3 workers or housekeeping staff, along with a 
	crowbar and spade, to do a bit of digging for placing the bamboo 
	poles. </li>
	<li>Some young volunteers from the community too are welcome to 
	join the effort.</li>
</ol>
<b>Managing the Compost Center:</b>
<ol style="line-height:20px;">
	<li>
		Have the material mixed daily by the workers using a rake, 
		including the content from the bottom.
	</li>
	<li>Ensure right moisture levels. </li>
	<li>Once a bed is full, start filling in another bed the fresh 
	waste and let the contents in the old pot just cook(break down) 
	for a few days.</li>
	<li>The natural openings at the bottom of the compost bed allow any 
	excess water collected to drain off. And as long as the moisture 
	level are maintained at the right levels and the compost is 
	thoroughly mixed every day or on alternate days, there should 
	not be any issue with odour or other pests.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="padding-left:0px">Donation of bulky items</h3>
<p>Interested donors who wish to donate in kind, large and bulky items, 
can now post this information on 
<a href="http://www.yousee.in/donate_in_kind.php">UC website</a> 
for NGOs to know. </p>
<h3 style="padding-left:0px">Donation of Clothes</h3>
<b>Some points to think about before we decide to donate old clothes:
</b>
<ol style="line-height:20px;">
	<li>Am I giving away good to use clothes, so that I can find an 
	excuse to shop for new clothes? Would it not be a good idea to 
	rather spend that money to buy and give something that an NGO or a 
	Social Cause really needs?
	</li>
	<li>Let me only give clothes which are in neat condition. I give 
	them possibly because they do not fit me any longer, but can be 
	worn with dignity by anyone else. Let me not give any undergarments 
	or soiled clothes.</li>
	<li>Too many clothes donated by too many people on a single day 
	pose a challenge for NGOs to manage the collection. They do not 
	have adequate resources to store, sort and distribute these clothes 
	in one go. Such a large collection would be ideal when there is a 
	natural calamity to respond to quickly. At other times, it would be 
	better to donate these clothes on a regular basis at the monthly 
	collections camps organised by UC ( www.yousee.in ) or at 
	Goonj offices ( www.goonj.org ), making it easier for them to 
	manage the logistics involved.</li>
